      HE could endure the quiet waiting in the carriage no longer; it was easier
      to get out and walk up and down. It was now dark; the few scattered lamps
      in the narrow side street quivered uneasily in the wind. The rain had
      stopped, the sidewalks were almost dry, but the rough-paved roadway was
      still moist, and little pools gleamed here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; thought Franz. &ldquo;Here we are scarcely a hundred paces
      from the Prater, and yet it might be a street in some little country town.
      Well, it&rsquo;s safe enough, at any rate. She won&rsquo;t meet any of the friends she
      dreads so much here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch. &ldquo;Only just seven, and so dark already! It is an
      early autumn this year... and then this confounded storm I...&rdquo; He turned
      his coat-collar up about his neck and quickened his pacing. The glass in
      the street lamps rattled lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour more,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;then I can go home. I could
      almost wish&mdash;that that half-hour were over.&rdquo; He stood for a moment on
      the corner, where he could command a view of both streets. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll surely
      come to-day,&rdquo; his thoughts ran on, while he struggled with his hat, which
      threatened to blow away. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Friday.... Faculty meeting at the
      University; she needn&rsquo;t hurry home.&rdquo; He heard the clanging of street-car
      gongs, and the hour chimed from a nearby church tower. The street became
      more animated. Hurrying figures passed him, clerks of neighboring shops;
      they hastened onward, fighting against the storm. No one noticed him; a
      couple of half-grown girls glanced up in idle curiosity as they went by.
      Suddenly he saw a familiar figure coming toward him. He hastened to meet
      her.... Could it be she? On foot?
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw him, and quickened her pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are walking?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dismissed the cab in front of the theatre. I think I&rsquo;ve had that driver
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man passed them, turning to look at the lady. Her companion glared at
      him, and the other passed on hurriedly. The lady looked after him. &ldquo;Who
      was it?&rdquo; she asked, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know him. We&rsquo;ll see no one we know here, don&rsquo;t worry. But come now,
      let&rsquo;s get into the cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An open one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was warm and pleasant when I engaged it an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked to the carriage; the lady stepped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driver!&rdquo; called the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where is he?&rdquo; asked the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz looked around. &ldquo;Well, did you ever? I don&rsquo;t see him anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;&rdquo; her tone was low and timid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment, child, he must be around here somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man opened the door of a little saloon, and discovered his
      driver at a table with several others. The man rose hastily. &ldquo;In a minute,
      sir,&rdquo; he explained, swallowing his glass of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir... Be there in a minute.&rdquo; His step was a little unsteady
      as he hastened to his horses. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll you go, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prater&mdash;Summer-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Franz entered the carriage. His companion sat back in a corner, crouching
      fearsomely under the shadow of the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took both her hands in his. She sat silent. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you say good evening
      to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a moment to rest, dear. I&rsquo;m still out of breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back in his corner. Neither spoke for some minutes. The carriage
      turned into the Prater Street, passed the Tegethoff Monument, and a few
      minutes later was rolling swiftly through the broad, dark Prater Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emma turned suddenly and flung both arms around her lover&rsquo;s neck. He
      lifted the veil that still hung about her face, and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have you again&mdash;at last!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how long it is since we have seen each other?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that wasn&rsquo;t good for much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? You were in our house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;in your house. That&rsquo;s just it. This can&rsquo;t go on. I shall not
      enter your house again.... What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A carriage passed us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear girl, the people who are driving in the Prater at such an hour, and
      in such weather, aren&rsquo;t noticing much what other people are doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s so. But some one might look in here, by chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t be recognized. It&rsquo;s too dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but can&rsquo;t we drive somewhere else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you like.&rdquo; He called to the driver, who did not seem to hear.
      Franz leaned forward and touched the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn around again. What are you whipping your horses like that for? We&rsquo;re
      in no hurry, I tell you. Drive&mdash;let me see&mdash;yes&mdash;drive down
      the avenue that leads to the Reichs Bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Reichsstrasse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But don&rsquo;t hurry so, there&rsquo;s no need of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir. But it&rsquo;s the wind that makes the horses so crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Franz sat back again as the carriage turned in the other direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I see you yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were invited to my sister&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t be with you&mdash;like that&mdash;with others around. No,
      I just can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She shivered. &ldquo;Where are we now?&rdquo; she asked, after a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were passing under the railroad bridge at the entrance to the
      Reichsstrasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the way to the Danube,&rdquo; replied Franz. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re driving toward the
      Reichs Bridge. We&rsquo;ll certainly not meet any of our friends here,&rdquo; he
      added, with a touch of mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage jolts dreadfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on cobblestones again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he drives so crooked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you only think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had begun to notice himself that the vehicle was swaying to and fro
      more than was necessary, even on the rough pavement. But he said nothing,
      not wishing to alarm her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great deal I want to say to you today, Emma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better begin then; I must be home at nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few words may decide everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, goodness, what was that!&rdquo; she screamed. The wheels had caught in a
      car-track, and the carriage turned partly over as the driver attempted to
      free it. Franz caught at the man&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why,
      you&rsquo;re drunk, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The driver halted his horses with some difficulty. &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out here, Emma, and walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the bridge already. And the wind is not nearly as strong as it
      was. It will be nicer to walk a little. It&rsquo;s so hard to talk in the
      carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma drew down her veil and followed him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call this windy?&rdquo; she
      exclaimed as she struggled against the gust that met her at the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her arm, and called to the driver to follow them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on slowly. Neither spoke as they mounted the ascent of the
      bridge; and they halted where they could hear the flow of the water below
      them. Heavy darkness surrounded them. The broad stream stretched itself
      out in gray, indefinite outlines; red lights in the distance, floating
      above the water, awoke answering gleams from its surface. Trembling
      stripes of light reached down from the shore they had just left; on the
      other side of the bridge the river lost itself in the blackness of open
      fields. Thunder rumbled in the distance; they looked over to where the red
      lights soared. A train with lighted windows rolled between iron arches
      that seemed to spring up out of the night for an instant, to sink back
      into darkness again. The thunder grew fainter and more distant; silence
      fell again; only the wind moved, in sudden gusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz spoke at last, after a long silence. &ldquo;We must go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Emma answered, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go away,&rdquo; he continued, with more animation. &ldquo;Go away altogether,
      I mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only because we are cowards, Emma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will let you have the boy, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how shall we go?&rdquo; Her voice was very low. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;to run away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. You have only to be honest with him; to tell him that you
      cannot live with him any longer; that you belong to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Franz&mdash;are you mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will spare you that trial, if you wish. I will tell him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Franz, you will do nothing of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He endeavored to read her face. But the darkness showed him only that her
      head was turned toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent a few moments more. Then he spoke quietly: &ldquo;You need not
      fear; I shall not do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked toward the farther shore. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear a noise?&rdquo; she asked.
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something is coming from the other side,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slow rumbling came out of the darkness. A little red light gleamed out
      at them. They could see that it hung from the axle of a clumsy country
      cart, but they could not see whether the cart was laden or not and whether
      there were human beings on it. Two other carts followed the first. They
      could just see the outlines of a man in peasant garb on the last cart, and
      could see that he was lighting his pipe. The carts passed them slowly.
      Soon there was nothing to be heard but the low rolling of the wheels as
      their own carriage followed them. The bridge dropped gently to the farther
      shore. They saw the street disappear into blackness between rows of trees.
      Open fields lay before them to the right and to the left; they gazed out
      into gloom indistinguishable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another long silence before Franz spoke again. &ldquo;Then it is the
      last time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&mdash;&rdquo; Emma&rsquo;s tone was anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last time we are to be together. Stay with him, if you will. I bid
      you farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now you see, it is you who always spoil the few hours we have
      together?&mdash;not I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Franz. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drive back to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held his arm closer. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she insisted, tenderly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go
      back. I won&rsquo;t be sent away from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew his head down to hers, and kissed him tenderly. &ldquo;Where would we
      get to if we drove on down there?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the road to Prague, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go quite that far,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to drive on a
      little, down there.&rdquo; She pointed into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz called to the driver. There was no answer; the carriage rumbled on,
      slowly. Franz ran after it, and saw that the driver was fast asleep. Franz
      roused him roughly. &ldquo;We want to drive on down that street. Do you hear
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma entered the carriage first, then Franz. The driver whipped his
      horses, and they galloped madly over the moist earth of the road-bed. The
      couple inside the cab held each other closely as they swayed with the
      motion of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this quite nice?&rdquo; whispered Emma, her lips on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the moment of her words she seemed to feel the cab mounting into the
      air. She felt herself thrown over violently, readied for some hold, but
      grasped only the empty air. She seemed to be spinning madly like a top,
      her eyes closed, suddenly she found herself lying on the ground, a great
      silence about her, as if she were alone, far away from all the world. Then
      noises began to come into her consciousness again; hoofs beat the ground
      near her; a low moaning came from somewhere; but she could see nothing.
      Terror seized her; she screamed aloud. Her terror grew stronger, for she
      could not hear her own voice. Suddenly she knew what had happened; the
      carriage had hit some object, possibly a mile-stone; had upset, and she
      had been thrown out. Where is Franz? was her next thought. She called his
      name. And now she could hear her voice, not distinctly yet, but she could
      hear it. There was no answer to her call. She tried to get up. After some
      effort she rose to a sitting, posture, and, reaching out, she felt
      something, a human body, on the ground beside her. She could now begin to
      see a little through the dimness. Franz lay beside her, motionless. She
      put out her hand and touched his face; something warm and wet covered it.
      Her heart seemed to stop beating&mdash;Blood?&mdash;Oh, what had happened?
      Franz was wounded and unconscious. Where was the coachman? She called him,
      but no answer came. She still sat there on the ground. She did not seem to
      be injured, although she ached all over. &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she thought;
      &ldquo;what shall I do? How can it be that I am not injured? Franz!&rdquo; she called
      again. A voice answered from somewhere near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you, lady? And where is the gentleman? Wait a minute, Miss&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      light the lamps, so we can see. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s got into the beasts
      to-day. It ain&rsquo;t my fault, Miss, sure&mdash;they ran into a pile of
      stones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma managed to stand up, although she was bruised all over. The fact that
      the coachman seemed quite uninjured reassured her somewhat. She heard the
      man opening the lamp and striking a match. She waited anxiously for the
      light. She did not dare to touch Franz again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so much worse when
      you can&rsquo;t see plainly,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;His eyes may be open now&mdash;there
      won&rsquo;t be anything wrong....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tiny ray of light came from one side. She saw the carriage, not
      completely upset, as she had thought, but leaning over toward the ground,
      as if one wheel were broken. The horses stood quietly. She saw the
      milestone, then a heap of loose stones, and beyond them a ditch. Then the
      light touched Franz&rsquo;s feet, crept up over his body to his face, and rested
      there. The coachman had set the lamp on the ground beside the head of the
      unconscious man. Emma dropped to her knees, and her heart seemed to stop
      beating as she looked into the face before her. It was ghastly white; the
      eyes were half open, only the white showing. A thin stream of blood
      trickled down from one temple and ran into his collar. The teeth were
      fastened into the under lip. &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; Emma
      spoke, as if to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver knelt also and examined the face of the man. Then he took the
      head in both his hands and raised it. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; screamed Emma,
      hoarsely, shrinking back at the sight of the head that seemed to be rising
      of its own volition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Miss&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;I&rsquo;m thinking&mdash;there&rsquo;s a great
      misfortune happened&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;it&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; said Emma. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true!&mdash;You
      are not hurt? Nor am I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man let the head he held fall back again into the lap of the trembling
      Emma. &ldquo;If only some one would come&mdash;if the peasants had only passed
      fifteen minutes later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; asked Emma, her lips trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, Miss, if the carriage was all right&mdash;but it&rsquo;s no good
      as it is&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to wait till some one comes&mdash;&rdquo; he talked on,
      but Emma did not hear him. Her brain seemed to awake suddenly, and she
      knew what was to be done. &ldquo;How far is it to the nearest house?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much further, Miss&mdash;there&rsquo;s Franz-Josef&rsquo;s land right there. We&rsquo;d
      see the houses if it was lighter&mdash;it won&rsquo;t take five minutes to get
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go there, then; I&rsquo;ll stay here&mdash;Go and fetch some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better stay here with you, Miss. Somebody must come; it&rsquo;s the
      main road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be too late; we need a doctor at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coachman looked down at the quiet face, then he looked at Emma, and
      shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss&mdash;but there&rsquo;ll be no doctor in those houses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;ll be somebody to send to the city&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Miss&mdash;they&rsquo;ll be having a telephone there, anyway! We&rsquo;ll
      telephone to the Rescue Society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s it. Go at once, run&mdash;and bring some men back with
      you. Why do you wait? Go at once. Hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man looked down again at the white face in her lap. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no
      use here for doctor or Rescue Society, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go!&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, Miss&mdash;but don&rsquo;t get afraid in the darkness here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried down the street. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t my fault,&rdquo; he murmured as he ran.
      &ldquo;Such an idea! to drive down this road this time o&rsquo; night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emma was left alone with the unconscious man in the gloomy street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do now?&rdquo; she thought &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be possible&mdash;it can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
       The thought circled dizzily in her brain&mdash;&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be possible.&rdquo;
       Suddenly she seemed to hear a low breathing. She bent to the pale lips&mdash;no&mdash;not
      the faintest breath came from them. The blood had dried on temple and
      cheek. She gazed at the eyes, the half-closed eyes, and shuddered. Why
      couldn&rsquo;t she believe it?... It must be true&mdash;this was Death! A shiver
      ran through her&mdash;she felt but one thing&mdash;&ldquo;This is a corpse. I am
      here alone with a corpse!&mdash;a corpse that rests on my lap!&rdquo; With
      trembling hands she pushed the head away, until it rested on the ground.
      Then a feeling of horrible alone-ness came over her. Why had she sent the
      coachman away? What should she do here all alone with this dead man in the
      darkness? If only some one would come&mdash;but what was she to do then if
      anybody did come? How long would she have to wait here? She looked down at
      the corpse again. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not alone with him,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;the light is
      there.&rdquo; And the light seemed to her to become alive, something sweet and
      friendly, to which she owed gratitude. There was more life in this little
      flame than in all the wide night about her. It seemed almost as if this
      light was a protection for her, a protection against the terrible pale man
      who lay on the ground beside her. She stared into the light until her eyes
      wavered and the flame began to dance. Suddenly she felt herself awake&mdash;wide
      awake. She sprang to her feet. Oh, this would not do! It would not do at
      all&mdash;no one must find her here with him. She seemed to be outside of
      herself, looking at herself standing there on the road, the corpse and the
      light below her; she saw herself grow into strange, enormous proportions,
      high up into the darkness. &ldquo;What am I waiting for?&rdquo; she asked herself, and
      her brain reeled. &ldquo;What am I waiting for? The people who might come? They
      don&rsquo;t need me. They will come, and they will ask questions&mdash;and I&mdash;why
      am I here? They will ask who I am&mdash;what shall I answer? I will not
      answer them&mdash;I will not say a word&mdash;they cannot compel me to
      talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of voices came from the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already?&rdquo; she thought, listening in terror. The voices came from the
      bridge. It could not be the men the driver was bringing with him. But
      whoever it was would see the light&mdash;and they must not see it, for
      then she would be discovered. She overturned the lantern with her foot,
      and the light went out. She stood in utter darkness. She could see nothing&mdash;not
      even him. The pile of % stones shone dimly. The voices came nearer. She
      trembled from head to foot; they must not find her here. That was the only
      thing of real importance in all the wide world&mdash;that no one should
      find her here. She would be lost if they knew that this&mdash;this corpse&mdash;was
      her lover. She clasps her hands convulsively, praying that the people,
      whoever they were, might pass by on the farther side of the road, and not
      see her. She listens breathless. Yes, they are there, on the other side&mdash;women,
      two women, or perhaps three. What are they talking about? They have seen
      the carriage, they speak of it&mdash;she can distinguish words. &ldquo;A
      carriage upset&mdash;&rdquo; What else do they say? She cannot understand&mdash;they
      walk on&mdash;they have passed her&mdash;Ah&mdash;thanks&mdash;thanks to
      Heaven!&mdash;And now? What now? Oh, why isn&rsquo;t she dead, as he is? He is
      to be envied; there is no more danger, no more fear for him. But so much&mdash;so
      much for her to tremble for. She shivers at the thought of being found
      here, of being asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; She will have to go to the police
      station, and all the world will know about it&mdash;her husband&mdash;her
      child. She cannot understand why she has stood there motionless so long.
      She need not stay here&mdash;she can do no good here&mdash;and she is only
      courting disaster for herself. She makes a step forward&mdash;Careful! the
      ditch is here&mdash;she crosses it&mdash;how wet it is&mdash;two paces
      more and she is in the middle of the street. She halts a moment, looks
      straight ahead, and can finally distinguish the gray line of the road
      leading onward into darkness. There&mdash;over there&mdash;lies the city.
      She cannot see it, but she knows the way. She turns once more. It does not
      seem so dark now. She can see the carriage and the horses quite distinctly&mdash;and,
      looking hard, she seems to see the outline of a human body on the ground.
      Her eyes open wide. Something seems to clutch at her and hold her here&mdash;it
      is he&mdash;she feels his power to keep her with him. With an effort she
      frees herself. Then she perceives that it was the soft mud of the road
      that held her. And she walks onward&mdash;faster&mdash;faster&mdash;her
      pace quickens to a run. Only to be away from here, to be back in the light&mdash;in
      the noise&mdash;among men. She runs along the street, raising her skirt
      high, that her steps may not be hindered. The wind is behind her, and
      seems to push her along. She does not know what it is she flees from. Is
      it the pale man back there by the ditch? No, now she knows, she flees the
      living, not the dead, the living, who will soon be there, and who will
      look for her. What will they think? Will they follow her? But they cannot
      catch up with her now, she is so far away, she is nearing the bridge,
      there is danger. No one can know who she was, no one can possibly imagine
      who the woman was who drove down through the country road with the dead
      man. The driver does not know her; he would not recognize her if he should
      ever see her again. They will not take the trouble to find out who she is.
      Who cares? It was wise of her not to stay&mdash;and it was not cowardly
      either. Franz himself would say it was wise. She must go home; she has a
      husband, a child; she would be lost if any one should see her there with
      her dead lover. There is the bridge; the street seems lighter&mdash;she
      hears the water beneath her. She stands there, where they stood together,
      arm in arm&mdash;when was it? How many hours ago? It cannot be long since
      then. And yet&mdash;perhaps she lay unconscious long, and it is midnight
      now, or near morning, and they have missed her at home. Oh, no&mdash;it is
      not possible. She knows that she was not unconscious, she remembers
      everything clearly. She runs across the bridge, shivering at the sound of
      her own steps. Now she sees a figure coming toward her; she slows her
      pace. It is a man in uniform. She walks more slowly, she does not want to
      attract attention. She feels the man&rsquo;s eyes resting on her&mdash;suppose
      he stops her! Now he is quite near; it is a policeman. She walks calmly
      past him, and hears him stop behind her. With an effort she continues in
      the same slow pace. She hears the jingle of street-car bells&mdash;ah, it
      cannot be midnight yet. She walks more quickly&mdash;hurrying toward the
      city, the lights of which begin there by the railroad viaduct&mdash;the
      growing noise tells her how near she is. One lonely stretch of street, and
      then she is safe. Now she hears a shrill whistle coming rapidly nearer&mdash;a
      wagon flies swiftly past her. She stops and looks after it; it is the
      ambulance of the Rescue Society. She knows where it is going. &ldquo;How quickly
      they have come,&rdquo; she thinks; &ldquo;it is like magic.&rdquo; For a moment she feels
      that she must call to them, must go back with them. Shame, terrible,
      overwhelming shame, such las she has never known before, shakes her from
      head to foot&mdash;she knows how vile, how cowardly she is. Then, as the
      whistle and the rumble of wheels fade away in the distance, a mad joy
      takes hold of her. She is saved&mdash;saved! She hurries on; she meets
      more people, but she does not fear them&mdash;the worst is over. The noise
      of the city grows louder, the street is lighter, the skyline of the Prater
      street rises before her, and she knows that she can sink into a flood tide
      of humanity there and lose herself in it. When she comes to a street lamp
      she is quite calm enough now to take out her watch and look at it. It is
      ten minutes to nine. She holds the watch to her ear&mdash;it is ticking
      merrily. And she thinks: &ldquo;Here I am, alive, unharmed&mdash;and he&mdash;he&mdash;dead.
      It is Fate.&rdquo; She feels as if all had been forgiven&mdash;as if she had
      never sinned. And what if Fate had willed otherwise? If it were she lying
      there in the ditch, and he who remained alive? He would not have run away&mdash;but
      then he is a man. She is only a woman, she has a husband, a child&mdash;it
      was her right&mdash;her duty&mdash;to save herself. She knows that it was
      not a sense of duty that impelled her to do it. But what she has done was
      right&mdash;she had done right instinctively&mdash;as all good people do.
      If she had stayed she would have been discovered by this time. The doctors
      would question her. And all the papers would report it next morning; she
      would have been ruined forever, and yet her ruin could not bring him back
      to life. Yes, that was the main point, her sacrifice would have been all
      in vain. She crosses under the railway bridge and hurries on. There is the
      Tegethoff Column, where so many streets meet. There are but few people in
      the park on this stormy evening, but to her it seems as if the life of the
      city was roaring about her. It was so horribly still back there. She had
      plenty of time now. She knows that her husband will not be home before ten
      o&rsquo;clock. She will have time to change her clothes. And then it occurs to
      her to look at her gown. She is horrified to see how soiled it is. What
      shall she say to the maid about it? And next morning the papers will all
      bring the story of the accident, and they will tell of a woman. Who had
      been in the carriage, and who had run away. She trembled afresh. One
      single carelessness and she is lost, even now. But she has her latch-key
      with her; she can let herself in; no one will hear her come. She jumps
      into a cab and is about to give her address, then suddenly she remembers
      that this would not be wise. She gives any number that occurs to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she drives through the Prater street she wishes that she might feel
      something&mdash;grief-horror&mdash;but she cannot. She has but one
      thought, one desire&mdash;to be at home, in safety. All else is
      indifferent to her. When she had decided to leave him alone, dead, by the
      roadside&mdash;in that moment everything seemed to have died within her,
      everything that would mourn and grieve for him. She has no feeling but
      that of fear for herself. She is not heartless&mdash;she knows that the
      day will come when her sorrow will be despair&mdash;it may kill her even.
      But she knows nothing now, except the desire to sit quietly at home, at
      the supper table with her husband and child. She looks out through the cab
      window. She is driving through the streets of the inner city. It is
      brilliantly light here, and many people hurry past. Suddenly all that she
      has experienced in the last few hours seems not to be true, it is like an
      evil dream; not something real, irreparable. She stops her cab in one of
      the side streets of the Ring, gets out, turns a corner quickly, and takes
      another carriage, giving her own address this time. She does not seem able
      to think of anything any more. &ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; She closes her eyes and
      sees him on the litter, in the ambulance. Suddenly she feels that he is
      here beside her. The cab sways, she feels the terror of being thrown out
      again, and she screams aloud. The cab halts before the door of her home.
      She dismounts hastily, hurries with light steps through the house door,
      unseen by the concierge, runs up the stairs, opens her apartment door very
      gently, aind slips unseen into her own room. She undresses hastily, hiding
      the mud-stained clothes in her cupboard. To-morrow, when they are dry, she
      can clean them herself. She washes hands and face, and slips into a loose
      housegown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rings. She hears the maid open the door, she hears her husband&rsquo;s
      voice, and the rattle of his cane on the hat-stand. She feels she must be
      brave now or it will all have been in vain. She hurries to the
      dining-room, entering one door as her husband comes in at the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re home already?&rdquo; he asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; she replies, &ldquo;I have been home some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They evidently didn&rsquo;t hear you come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiles without effort. But it fatigues her horribly to have to smile.
      He kisses her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little boy is already at his place by the table. He has been waiting
      some time, and has fallen asleep, his head resting on an open book.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sits down beside him; her husband takes his chair opposite, takes up a
      paper, and glances carelessly at it. Then he says: &ldquo;The others are still
      talking away there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo; she asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he begins to tell her about the meeting, at length. Emma pretends to
      listen, and nods now and then. But she does not hear what he is saying,
      she feels dazed, like one who has escaped terrible danger as by a miracle;
      she can feel only this: &ldquo;I am safe; I am at home.&rdquo; And while her husband
      is talking she pulls her chair nearer the boy&rsquo;s and lifts his head to her
      shoulder. Fatigue inexpressible comes over her. She can no longer control
      herself; she feels that her eyes are closing, that she is dropping asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly another possibility presents itself to her mind, a possibility
      that she had dismissed the moment she turned to leave the ditch where she
      had fallen. Suppose he were not dead! Suppose&mdash;oh, but it is
      impossible&mdash;his eyes&mdash;his&mdash;lips&mdash;not a breath came
      from them! But there are trances that are like death, which deceive even
      practised eyes, and she knows nothing about such things. Suppose he is
      still alive&mdash;suppose he has regained consciousness and found himself
      alone by the roadside&mdash;suppose he calls her by her name? He might
      think she had been injured; he might tell the doctors that there was a
      woman with him, and that she must have been thrown to some distance. They
      will look for her. The coachman will come back with the men he has
      brought, and will tell them that she was there, unhurt&mdash;and Franz
      will know the truth. Franz knows her so well&mdash;he will know that she
      has run away&mdash;and a great anger will come over him. He will tell them
      her name in revenge. For he is mortally injured, and it will hurt him
      cruelly that she has left him alone in his last hour. He will say: &ldquo;That
      is Mrs. Emma &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. I am her lover. She is cowardly and
      stupid, too, gentlemen, for she might have known you would not ask her
      name; you would be discreet; you would have let her go away unmolested.
      Oh, she might at least have waited until you came. But she is vile&mdash;utterly
      vile&mdash;ah!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asks the Professor, very gravely, rising from his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, what is the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; She presses the boy closer to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor looks at her for a few minutes steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know that you had fallen asleep, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&mdash; And&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you screamed out in your sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You screamed as if you were having a nightmare. Were you dreaming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she sees her face in a mirror opposite, a face tortured into a ghastly
      smile. She knows it is her own face, and it terrifies her. She sees that
      it is frozen; that this hideous smile is frozen on it, and will always be
      there, all her life. She tries to cry out. Two hands are laid on her
      shoulders, and between her own face and the mirrored one her husband&rsquo;s
      face pushes its way in; his eyes pierce into hers. She knows that unless
      she is strong for this last trial all is lost. And she feels that she is
      strong; she has regained control of her limbs, but the moment of strength
      is short. She raises her hands to his, which rest on her shoulders; she
      draws him down to her, and smiles naturally and tenderly into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She feels his lips on her forehead, and she thinks: &ldquo;It is all a dream&mdash;he
      will never tell&mdash;he will never take revenge like that&mdash;he is
      dead&mdash;really dead&mdash;and the dead are silent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you say that?&rdquo; she hears her husband&rsquo;s voice suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She starts. &ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo; And it seems to her as if she had told
      everything, here at the table&mdash;aloud before every one&mdash;and again
      she asks, shuddering before his horrified eyes, &ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dead are silent,&rdquo; her husband repeats very slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she reads in his eyes that she can no longer hide anything from him.
      They look long and silently at each other. &ldquo;Put the boy to bed,&rdquo; he says
      at last. &ldquo;You have something to tell me, have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knows now that within a few moments she will tell this man everything&mdash;this
      man, whom she has deceived for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while she goes slowly through the door, holding her boy, she feels her
      husband&rsquo;s eyes still resting on her, and a great peace comes over her, the
      assurance that now many things would be right again.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the

through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
